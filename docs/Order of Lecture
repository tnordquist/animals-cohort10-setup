        - serialization is converting object into json string and deserialization is converting json
                  string into object
        - @Expose is used to allow or disallow serialization and deserialization. @Expose is
        optional and it has two configuration parameters: serialize and deserialize. By default
        they're set to true. To serialize and deserialize with @Expose we create gson object like
        this: Gson gsonBuilder = new GsonBuilder().excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation().create();
